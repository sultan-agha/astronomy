white holes are the theoretical opposites of black holes. They are theorized to exist based on the very same math and general relativity concepts as black holes,
 although we have yet to identify a stable example in the universe. If you were to observe a white hole from a distance, 
 it would look very much like a black hole functioning in reverse, with light and matter slowly spewing outwards from what would otherwise look like a black hole. 
 It is theorized that nothing is able to penetrate past a white hole’s event horizon, just as nothing can escape from within a black hole’s event horizon.
 The great mystery of such a white hole (as presently theorized) is that nothing could ever impact the contents of the white hole</p>

								 A wormhole (or Einstein–Rosen bridge or Einstein–Rosen wormhole) is a speculative structure linking disparate points in spacetime. 
A wormhole can be visualized as a tunnel with two ends at separate points in spacetime (i.e., different locations, different points in time, or both).
 Theoretically, a wormhole might connect extremely long distances such as a billion light years, or short distances such as a few meters, or different points in time, or even different universes.[2]
For a simplified notion of a wormhole, space can be visualized as a two-dimensional surface. 
In this case, a wormhole would appear as a hole in that surface, lead into a 3D tube (the inside surface of a cylinder), 
then re-emerge at another location on the 2D surface with a hole similar to the entrance. An actual wormhole would be analogous to this, 
but with the spatial dimensions raised by one. Another way to imagine wormholes is to take a sheet of paper and draw two somewhat distant points on one side of the paper. 
The sheet of paper represents a plane in the spacetime continuum, and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, 
but theoretically a wormhole could connect these two points by folding that plane (⁠i.e. the paper) so the points are touching. 
In this way it would be much easier to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching</p>
