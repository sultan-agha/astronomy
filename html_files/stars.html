                    <p class="product-desc">Stars are the most widely recognized astronomical objects, and represent the most fundamental building blocks of galaxies. The age, distribution, and composition of the stars in a galaxy trace the history, dynamics, and evolution of that galaxy. Moreover, stars are responsible for the manufacture and distribution of heavy elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and their characteristics are intimately tied to the characteristics of the planetary systems that may join each other. Consequently, the study of the birth, life, and death of stars is central to the field of astronomy.</p>

                    <h2 class="product-heading">STARS FORMATION</h1>
                    <p class="product-desc">Stars are born within the clouds of dust and scattered throughout most galaxies. A familiar example of such as a dust cloud is the Orion Nebula. As the cloud collapses, the material at the center begins to heat up. Known as a protostar, it is a hot core at the heart of the collapsing cloud that will one day become a star. Three-dimensional computer models of star formation predict that the spinning clouds of collapsing gas and dust may break up into two or three blobs; this would explain why the majority of stars are paired in groups of multiple stars. As the cloud collapses, hot core forms and begins gathering dust and gas.</p>

                    <h2 class="product-heading">FATE OF STARS</h1>
                    <p class="product-desc">In general, the larger a star, the shorter its life, although all but the most massive stars live for billions of years. When a star has fused all the hydrogen in its core, nuclear reactions stops. The energy production effects the core and begins collapsing itself and becomes much hotter. The increasingly hot core pushes the outer layers of the star outward, causing them to transform the star into a disaster.</p>
